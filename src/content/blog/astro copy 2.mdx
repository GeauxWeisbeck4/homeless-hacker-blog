**Have you ever been treated a certain way for being homeless, and just wondered - "what the actual fuck?" **

Well, you're not alone. Because of the way we are portrayed in society, the homeless get the brunt end of some really fucked up treatment. We've decided to write this post to help educate those who don't understand homelessness the way we do to understand what we go through and feel - and for those who have experienced those moments to know you deserve better.

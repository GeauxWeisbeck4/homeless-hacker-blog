**We couldn't do it without everyone's help - that's why we're asking for everyone's help!**

For Lisa and Andrew to survive, we must panhandle everyday for 4-6 excruciating hours. That's that many hours of holding a stupid sign, walking up and down the median like glowing targets for speeding traffic, and the eardrum splitting sound of loud cars blowing by you every 2 minutes, every single day.

We really think we are more creative than that and could put our resources to better use than holding a sign. If you agree, here is how you can help us today!

# Fastest and Most Convenient: CashApp, PayPal, and Venmo

The easiest and fastest way to help us out immediately, is to send CashApp donations to $lisaweisbeck4, send PayPal donations to [andrewweisbeck69](https://paypal.me/andrewweisbeck69) or send Vemo donations to @lisaweisbeck4. We've included donation buttons below for your convenience.

Contact us with your CashApp, PayPal, or Venmo handle and we will make you a receipt and email it to you for tax recording purposes (we are not a non-profit, not yet at least, so ask your tax consultant on how to report donations). This helps us to afford every living expense we need from Walmart, purchasing food, our YMCA Membership, and saving up for an apartment. We often need immediate liquidity so your contribution helps us to not have to panhandle and allows us to work on stuff like this blog!

# Membership Communities: Kofi, Patreon, and BuyMeACoffee

We have taken the time to set up membership communities where you can share content and creations with a community of supporters and followers, allowing them to "purchase you a cup of coffee" or "subscribe for membership benefits" by making monthly contributions. We are in the process of building our membership rewards as some of that will include our merchandise we are currently creating, extra content that is in the works, and exclusive rewards to some of our marketing affiliations.

You can make a one time donation or subscribe to the monthly membership tiers, which we are working on improving. If you sign up for a membership tier now, you will receive all rewards that come in the future - we don't want to skimp you on your benefits if you have been kind enough to help us out.

Here are the buttons that you can use to easily contribute to our membership communities.

Patreon, Kofi, and BuyMeACoffee all handle the donation process, which makes it easy for us to share content with members and grow our following using their tools and resources they have available to creators. We will keep you in the loop with our membership programs with blog posts and our newsletter that is in the works.

We will continue to add more membership communities in the future to support our growth.

# Affiliate Link Purchases and Amazon Prime Membership Bounties

One of the ways that we are able to make money while creating content is by using affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is sharing products as a representative of a company using special links that track purchases that are made via links shared on our blog website. Every purchase you make through one of our links from one of our partners, earns us a percentage of your purchase and puts money in our pockets!

We will often share links to products in our blog posts that we feel may be beneficial to you, whether you are homeless or not! There are also bounty programs through some of our affiliates, most notably Amazon, which earns us money simply by sharing a link for you to sign up with.

You can really help us out by signing up for any of the following Amazon benefit programs like Amazon Prime, Amazon Audible, and many other Amazon programs. Here are a list of the programs that offer free trials - all you have to do is sign up with our link and we earn a commission from Amazon!

# Coming Soon: Weisbums Print-On-Demand and Drop Shipping Store

We are currently working on a Shopify print-on-demand store that will feature our brand on high quality products like socks, t-shirts, hoodies, water bottles, and much more! It is a way that you can own some of our merchandise as a result of your direct help and support. We also plan on donating a pair of socks/other clothing to those in need once we get to a point where we can afford to do so in the future.

There will be more products featured on the store as we continue to work on building the storefront and add products to our inventory that we believe will sell well to our audience. We will have more info about this and be able to more effectively build our store out the more data we get by having website visitors and getting feedback from website users and such.

Stay tuned to learn more!

# Conclusion: Anything Helps, Especially Sharing This Blog!

We always are super appreciative of any help and support that we receive in any way. If you don't have the capability to support us financially at this time, you can always help support us by sharing our blog with your friends, family, and online communities that you think would find our content interesting, useful, or feel the need to help out a struggling couple on the streets.

Thank you for checking out this post about helping us out and we look forward to your generous help and support to help us out in making a living other than panhandling. Panhandling is dangerous, it seems to annoy people, and we feel that we can do much more creative and productive things with your time and money than holding a sign. So please consider helping us and we will continue to put out awesome content and products for your entertainment!

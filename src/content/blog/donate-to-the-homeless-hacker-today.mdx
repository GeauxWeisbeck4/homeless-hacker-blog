**We couldn't do it without everyone's help - that's why we're asking for everyone's help!**

For Lisa and Andrew to survive, we must panhandle everyday for 4-6 excruciating hours. That's that many hours of holding a stupid sign, walking up and down the median like glowing targets for speeding traffic, and the eardrum splitting sound of loud cars blowing by you every 2 minutes, every single day.

We really think we are more creative than that and could put our resources to better use than holding a sign. If you agree, here is how you can help us today!

# The Easiest Way: CashApp

The easiest and fastest way to help us out immediately, is to send CashApp donations to $lisaweisbeck4.

Contact us with your CashApp handle and we will make you a receipt and email it to you. This helps us to afford every living expense we need from Walmart and beyond, immediately. Thank you so much for contributions and God Bless Y'all!

title: Welcome to the Homeless Hacker Blog
---

Welcome to the Homeless Hacker Blog, a projected created by Andrew Weisbeck and Lisa Heusner. We appreciate you stopping by to check out our blog that shares our knowledge, survival tips, resources, and other hacks that will help those who are struggling with living on the streets. Our blog is also for those of you who are not homeless, but want to better understand homelessness or share our project with a loved one who you think could benefit from our content.

# 15 Months of Homeless Experience

This is more time spent homeless than anyone should have to experience, but we believe that our time without housing can be of benefit to our readers. Since we were kicked out of our last apartment, we have lived in hotels, in parking lots, tents, and even storage units. While living outside, we have learned how to make a living without work, how to work a job while homeless, and how to survive with limited resources. Our diverse and unique experience allows us to connect with a wide audience of homeless individuals, as we know there is not one correct way to live out here.

We've met people who have been doing this for years and met other people who have no idea what they're doing - this is important because we've learned what to do and what not to do. There are certain tricks for staying warm, hacks for eating cheaply/freely, and ways to approach other people on the streets. Our lived experience will teach you how to handle certain situations and survive on the streets.

We understand how scary and difficult every day is when you are homeless. That is why we hope you have landed here if you are seeking advice and knowledge that will help make things just a tad bit easier.

# Why Put Effort Into This Blog?

While we do have altruistic intentions on helping out the homeless and their family to better understand this vast problem that plagues the richest country in the world, we also have capitalistic intentions as well. We're just going to be honest - this project has taken a lot of time and effort and we would appreciate any kind of help and support that you can offer us. While we want to help out other homeless people, it is harder to help others when you can't help yourself.

We will provide ways that you can donate to our project with easy to use website components, but you can always send a little love our way by donating to our CashApp:

That is our main method of receiving help at the moment, but we intend on including many different ways that you can help us out. We thank you for all of your kindness and support in advance!

But we do hope our project can help families come to terms with their homeless loved ones and that those individuals suffering from homelessness can find guidance and help in our content and resources.

# What Else to Know

Well there is much more coming to this project as we have more time and effort to put into this when we have free time. Right now we have to spend a lot of our time panhandling just to survive on a daily basis. The more help you provide, the more we can create and share our skills and knowledge with you. There are some plans for how we intend on expanding this project and I've listed a few below:

- A store with outdoor gear and products that help the homeless
- Ways you can order homeless kits for those suffering in your community
- A newsletter
- YouTube channel with video content

There is much more we plan on releasing as this project keeps on coming together over time. We hope that you enjoy it and share this with your friends and family - it would really help us!

# Follow Us and Check In Frequently!

That is about all that I have to share with y'all in this welcome post. Keep checking in for more info about this project and to learn more about us and what we have to share with you about homelessness.

Thank you for reading and your support!

**If you have never tried to panhandle, you cannot understand how difficult it is the first time you step on a median or sidewalk and hold up that sign.**

That is why we have created our Panhandling 101 guide so you can feel just like a pro when you get out there with your sign. Follow these tips and you will be raking in cash in no time when you step out to fly a sign!

# It's All About Presentation

While there is often much debate between us panhandling folk about what factors are most important when you are holding a sign, the truth is that it all comes down to how you present yourself out there. This depends on quite a few different factors actually. It's not rocket science, but you do need to take quite a few things into consideration when you are planning on what you want to present to the people who may be giving you money.

Here are just a few things that you can think about to get you started:

- Looking homeless but nice vs. trying to look as homeless as possible
- Smiling and acting happy even though you may not feel good or are down in the dumps
- Simple sign messaging and not overly animated in greeting cars

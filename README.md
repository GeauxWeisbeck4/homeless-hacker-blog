# The Street Life Digest Blog

Welcome to the Homeless Hacker Blog, a project by Andrew Weisbeck and Lisa Heusner. We hope you enjoy our Homeless Hacks that we share with you and hope that you will share our project with your friends and family.

Any and all help is welcomed! We would love to change our situation and we believe this creative outlet is a great way to ask for your support and kindness.

Right now the best way to donate money to us is to send to our CashApp - $lisaweisbeck4 - but we are working on other ways that you can donate to our cause and help us out of homelessness!
